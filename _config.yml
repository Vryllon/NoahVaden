        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          My team and I worked to update the existing website as well as create a mobile app that would have similar functionality to the website to deploy onto the stores (for free).
          My specific focus on the project was in designing a web scraper that searches the web for content that users would be interested in and posts them to the site for admin approval.

          Working towards this degree has given me a chance to learn everything I need to work as a Software Engineer or related field.
          I have had the chance to communicate and collaborate with peers and teachers to grow my knoledge in various CS topics and have learned a lot of interpersonal and teamwork skills through this oppurtunity.
          In persuing this degree, I have gotten hands on experience in how to create quality software that will improve productivity for a wide range of people.
